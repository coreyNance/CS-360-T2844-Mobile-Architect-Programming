-   Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
<br>
<br>
The goal of the “Lets Race” application is an application that helps the user easily locate local racing events. Through this application, the user will be able to register for track events as well as post their own track events. 

<br>
<br>

-   What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
<br>
<br>
To try and support the user's needs. there neeeded to be screens for users to be able to log in or sign up.  Then a screen for the race tracks to be displayed and the ability to add, edit and remove tracks.  These added features would also have their own screens.  Lastly there needed to be a settings page where the user can opt in or out of SMS text message notifications.  Each screen was developed to accomplish these tasks which in the end will lead to a successful user experience.

-   How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
<br>
<br>
Basically, my approach to coding the app is to code the easiest implementation first.  But with that said it has to go along with the hosing image type of approach I take which is picturing each screen as a room in a house.  Going from screen to screen is like walking from one room to the other.  Understaning this help with needing to understand how the application needs to work.  This type of technique can be easily used in any app development.  The best way to think of it is sometimes a person may want to go from the kitchen to the bathroom, the way they came to the kitchen was from the bedroom, through the living room, and to the kitchen and the bathroom is near the bedroom.  To get to the bathroom, the user may not want to back track through all those other rooms and would rather have a nice direct path from the kitchen to the bathroom.  This can be said for coding too, a user may not want to backtrack through all the screens they visited just to get to the screen of choice. 




-   How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
<br>
<br>
For me, testing the code consisted of running it in an emulator to walk through the application like a user. While doing that, the next task was to find edge cases where the code could possibly fail and if it did, why did it fail.  This process is important so that bugs are found and the app is protected against user errors as well.  With in the testing, there were a few bugs found like the home button in settings not going back to the home page.
<br>
<br>  

-   Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
<br>
<br>
The entire app was a challenge.  When it came to UI design, that was not too bad, but when it came to implementing the features, then the challenges started.  The main way as of right now to overcome some of the challenges was really just to change the way it was implemented.  One example was changing a pop up to another screen. 
<br>
<br>

-   In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
<br>
<br>
The most successful area was being able to get the SMS permission Toggle to work in the settings menu.  It took alot of research to fully understand how the toggle switch worked.  Another area of success was getting the username and passwords to save to the database.  This was another challenge to implement due to the original code being very complicated.
